Summary: Genotype imputation has become a standard tool in genetics, but performing this analysis correctly requires a lot of expertize and is time and labor intensive. We developed an impute2-based genotype imputation workflow that greatly simplifies the process of imputation using multiple CPUâ€™s on a computer cluster. The users simply supplies a gen-otype dataset and the workflow implements detailed steps of matching the strand of the input genotypes and reference, smart segmentation of the genome, and generation of QC metrics.
Availability and Implementation: The workflow works on the two most popular cluster management systems, Sun Grid Engine (SGE) and Portable Batch System (PBS). Available under the GNU public license
